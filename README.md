README for Zombie Apocalypse Game by Nick Liccini

//// DESCRIPTION \\\\
Take cover! Zombies have risen and are taking over the world! You are 
	one of the few people left who can save us. Grab your blaster and 
	get moving; the world needs a hero.

Each level gets harder so you better be quick to the draw!

//// GAMEPLAY HINTS \\\\
- You will always spawn in the top left corner, this is the safe zone 
	where zombies cannot hit you
- You only have limited ammo when you pick up the blaster, if you run 
	out you lose
- Each level is different every time you play so there's no trick to 
	beating any particular level
